### 一些AI项目

#### ONNX
https://github.com/onnx/onnx

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is the first step toward an open ecosystem that empowers AI developers to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types. Initially we focus on the capabilities needed for inferencing (evaluation).

Caffe2, PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Apache MXNet and other tools are developing ONNX support. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production will increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. We are an early stage and we invite the community to submit feedback and help us further evolve ONNX.

#### MXNet Model Server

https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server

Apache MXNet Model Server (MMS) is a flexible and easy to use tool for serving deep learning models exported from MXNet or the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX).

Use the MMS Server CLI, or the pre-configured Docker images, to start a service that sets up HTTP endpoints to handle model inference requests.

#### Featuretools

https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools

Featuretools is a python library for automated feature engineering.

#### CNTK

https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK

Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), an open source deep-learning toolkit

#### BigDL

https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL

BigDL: Distributed Deep Learning on Apache Spark

#### Python Codes in Data Science

https://github.com/RubensZimbres/Repo-2017

Python codes in Machine Learning, NLP, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning with Keras and Theano

### NLP

#### Oxford NLP Lectures

https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures

This repository contains the lecture slides and course description for the Deep Natural Language Processing course offered in Hilary Term 2017 at the University of Oxford.

#### DeepQA

https://github.com/allenai/deep_qa

DeepQA is a library for doing high-level NLP tasks with deep learning, particularly focused on various kinds of question answering. DeepQA is built on top of Keras and TensorFlow, and can be thought of as an interface to these systems that makes NLP easier.

#### Deep - NLP

https://github.com/siddk/deep-nlp

This repository contains Tensorflow implementations of various deep learning models, with a focus on problems in Natural Language Processing. Each individual subdirectory is self-contained, addressing one specific model.

#### baseline

https://github.com/dpressel/baseline

Simple, Strong Deep-Learning Baselines for NLP in several frameworks

Baseline algorithms and data support implemented with multiple deep learning tools, including sentence classification, tagging, seq2seq, and language modeling. Can be used as stand-alone command line tools or as a Python library. The library attempts to provide a common interface for several common deep learning tasks, as well as easy-to-use file loaders to make it easy to publish standard results, compare against strong baselines without concern for mistakes and to support rapid experiments to try and beat these baselines.

#### Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

https://github.com/nltk/nltk

NLTK -- the Natural Language Toolkit -- is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing.

#### MXNet

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet

Apache MXNet (incubating) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. MXNet is portable and lightweight, scaling effectively to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.

MXNet is also more than a deep learning project. It is also a collection of blue prints and guidelines for building deep learning systems, and interesting insights of DL systems for hackers.

### 一些区块链项目

#### Hyperledger

https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger

Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology. The Linux Foundation hosts Hyperledger under the foundation.

#### 区块链技术指南

https://github.com/yeasy/blockchain_guide

本书希望可以探索区块链概念的来龙去脉，剥茧抽丝，剖析关键技术原理，同时讲解实践应用。在开发相关开源分布式账本平台（如超级账本），以及设计基于区块链的企业方案过程中，笔者积累了一些实践经验，也通过本书一并分享出来，希望能推动区块链技术的早日成熟和更多应用场景的出现。
